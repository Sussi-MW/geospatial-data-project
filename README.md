# Project: GeoSpatial Data
## by Susana Martin Wanton

## Goal: Place the new company offices in the best place.

The objective of this project is
define the location of a property that will be used as offices of a new company in the `GAMING industry`.

The analysis of the location is based on a survey carried out with the employees, in which they indicated their preferences regarding the environment.

The possible location of the office is defined with the help of queries to a database that contains more than 18k documents from different companies around the world, and each of them has a lot of information about each of the companies.

In addition, to obtain data from the closest places of interest, an information search is carried out in the Foursquare API, a service based on web location applied to social networks.
